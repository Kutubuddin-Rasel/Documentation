## Abstract

This internship project presents DhakaVoice, a full-stack civic engagement platform designed to revolutionize complaint management for Dhaka's 21+ million citizens. The platform addresses critical gaps in urban governance by providing transparent, efficient digital complaint processing with real-time tracking and community engagement features.

DhakaVoice was developed using modern web technologies including Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, NestJS, and PostgreSQL. The platform implements comprehensive features including secure user authentication, image upload with automatic WebP optimization, real-time complaint tracking, and community engagement capabilities. The system handles image uploads up to 5MB with automatic processing and optimization for efficient storage.

Key technical achievements include a complete RESTful API with 15 endpoints, JWT-based authentication system, and responsive design supporting multiple device sizes. The platform supports comprehensive complaint lifecycle management covering 6 major categories (Roads, Electricity, Water, Pollution, Transport, Others) with status tracking through 3 distinct phases (Pending, In Progress, Resolved).

The application demonstrates significant potential for real-world civic engagement, supporting both DNCC and DSCC administrative structures covering 129 wards across 50+ thanas in Dhaka. The project showcases advanced full-stack development capabilities, modern web development practices, and comprehensive understanding of civic technology requirements.

## Introduction

### 1.1 Project Background

In the rapidly urbanizing landscape of Dhaka, Bangladesh, effective civic engagement has become increasingly crucial for maintaining and improving urban infrastructure and services. With a population exceeding 21 million people, Dhaka faces numerous urban challenges including inadequate road maintenance, electricity supply issues, water management problems, pollution concerns, and transportation inefficiencies.

Traditional complaint management systems in Dhaka have been largely paper-based or require physical visits to government offices, creating significant barriers to citizen participation. The lack of transparency in complaint processing, difficulty in tracking complaint status, and limited community engagement have resulted in low citizen satisfaction and reduced civic participation.

The digital transformation of civic engagement systems presents an opportunity to address these challenges by providing citizens with accessible, transparent, and efficient platforms for reporting and tracking civic issues. Modern web technologies enable the creation of user-friendly interfaces, real-time status updates, and community-driven features that can significantly enhance civic participation.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

The primary objective of this internship project was to develop a comprehensive digital platform that would:

1. **Digitize Complaint Management**: Create an intuitive web application for citizens to submit detailed complaints with photo documentation and precise location data.

2. **Enable Real-time Tracking**: Implement a system for citizens to monitor complaint progress from submission to resolution with transparent status updates.

3. **Foster Community Engagement**: Develop features for community interaction including upvoting, commenting, and sharing of complaints to highlight important civic issues.

4. **Ensure Accessibility**: Design a responsive, accessible platform that works seamlessly across all devices and follows international accessibility standards.

5. **Master Modern Technologies**: Gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge web development frameworks, databases, and deployment practices.

### 1.3 Scope and Limitations

**Geographic Scope**: The application focuses on Dhaka city, specifically covering both Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) areas, with a comprehensive thana and ward-based location system.

**User Base**: The platform serves two primary user groups:
- Citizens who submit and track complaints
- Administrators who manage and process complaints

**Technical Scope**: The project encompasses a complete full-stack web application with:
- Frontend: Modern React-based user interface
- Backend: RESTful API with authentication and data management
- Database: Relational database with optimized schema design
- File Storage: Cloud-based image storage and processing

**Limitations**: The current implementation focuses on web-based access, with mobile application development planned for future iterations. The system is designed for the specific administrative structure of Dhaka's city corporations.

## Literature Review & Technology Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Solutions Analysis

**International Civic Engagement Platforms**:

*FixMyStreet (UK)*: Launched in 2007, serving over 400,000 users annually with 95% problem resolution rate. Strengths include comprehensive geographic coverage and government integration. Limitations include basic UI design and limited community interaction features.

*SeeClickFix (USA)*: Operates in 300+ cities with 2.5 million registered users. Achieves average 14-day response time for reported issues. Notable for strong mobile adoption (70% mobile usage) and gamification features. Weakness in scalability for mega-cities like Dhaka.

*MyGov India*: Government-backed platform serving 200+ million citizens. Demonstrates successful large-scale implementation but limited in real-time tracking and community engagement. Average complaint resolution time of 21 days indicates room for efficiency improvements.

**Local Bangladesh Context**:

*Digital Bangladesh Initiative*: Government digitization efforts focus on service delivery but lack citizen-centric complaint management. Existing systems show 60% digital literacy barriers and limited mobile optimization.

*Research by BRAC University (2023)*: Studies indicate 78% of Dhaka citizens prefer digital complaint submission over traditional methods, but current systems achieve only 23% user satisfaction due to poor interface design and lack of transparency.

**Market Gap Analysis**: 
Current solutions fail to address Dhaka's specific challenges: extreme population density (23,000 people/km²), diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, and complex administrative structures (dual city corporation system). Existing platforms lack integration with local governance structures and culturally appropriate design patterns.
